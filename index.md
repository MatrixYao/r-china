The R conference provides a forum for discussion of statistical applications and statistical visulzation with analyzing tools. The conference brings together statisticians from academia, industry, and government to discuss ideas and advancements in the application of statistics to solving problems in real life.  It has been hosted by Capital of Statistics (COS) annually since 2008. COS  is the biggest online statistical community in China. We dedicate to the development, application, and dissemination of statistical science in China through meetings, online articles and salons.

This is a two-day conference consisting of invited speakers, workshop and poster presentations.  It is the largest gathering of R fans in China. The conference has a relaxed atmosphere to encourage discussions on papers and presentations with authors and other participants. This communication enhances the interface of statistics with business.

R conference is unique in China in that it emphasizes the application of statistics in solving real-life problems, highlighting business, while recognizing the joint effort of the statistician and people from business. Presentations made jointly by the statistician and data analysis department in companies are encouraged. Presentation of data sets and analyses which motivated the work was focused more than development of the statistical theory. Papers on either new or innovative applications of existing statistical methodologies are appropriate for presentation at this conference. Creative and brilliant ways for data visulization are very welcomed.
