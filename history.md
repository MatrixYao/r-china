#A Brief History of the Conference#

The idea for a Conference on Appling Statistics using R was hatched when a group of people in Capital of Statistics (COS) started to dedicate to the development, application, and dissemination of statistical science in China in 2006. They believed there would be great enthusiasm for a conference with an emphasis on the application of statistics using R software.  It is the largest gathering of R fans in China. Each year hundreds of people from industry, government, and academia across China attended. 

The conference was named R Conference and it was an immediate success. However, the range of topics covers more than just R. Statistical applications and visualization using any sofewares are welcomed. It has been held annually since 2008. It has sought to provide an intimate venue where researchers from government, industry, and academia, as well as students, could interact with one another on a face-to-face basis. Team-delivered talks in which subject matter scientists present scientific background and statisticians then discuss the challenges and solutions to data analysis have always been encouraged and well received.
 
In addition to a keynote address and contributed papers and posters, since 2013 the conference will include a technical workshop as well. A complete list of keynote speakers, their affiliations, keynote titles and workshop topics can be found below.
